# BrewDog Beers

This personal project is based on BrewDog, a brewery from Scotland with a multitude of beers. They shared their recipes from their back catalogue in the form of PDFs, which were then made into an API. Documentation for this can be found at: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2 

To get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/linh-pham-nz/brewdog-api
cd brewdog-api
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
