Future features:
- leave comment on particular beers using a FORM
- blog of progress using database
- search function
- dropdown menu on BeerList page for sorting e.g. by ABV

Current issues:
- when randomBeerButton is sticky, loses button functionality
- can't get nav links to display underneath Brew'd image logo
- when displaying all beers, sometimes API calls do not sort properly, does not display all etc.
have to refresh multiple times to display correctly
- when beer title is too long, affects size of card and cards around it

To Do:
- add Redux - getting complicated with passing state around
